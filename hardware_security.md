## Intellectual Property Protection
### Intellectual Property
- original idea which can be used to earn money
- IP: product, technology, software, ...
- Law protection: patent, copyright, trade secrete, tec

### VLSI Design IPs
- IP is a design unit that can be resonably viewd as a stand-alone sub-omponent of a complete SOC design
- Design IP: any inovation and technology that makes design better
	- Design algorithm, technique, methodology
	- Microprocessor, memory, Verilog chip description
- Virtual component, block, core, macro, ...

### Soft, Firm, and Hard Design IPs

### Why IP and IP Proctecion

- IP Reuse-base design
	- VSIA, VCX
	- Design and Reuse
	- IP-Highway
- Hardware IP Piracy
	- Reverse engineering
	- Chip overbuilding
	- Counterfeiting
	
### Goals of IP Protection
- Enable IP providers to protect their IPs against unauthorized use
- Protect all type of design data used to produce and deliver IPs
- Detect use of IPs
- Trace of IPs

### IP Protection: State-of-the-Art

## Watermarking Basics
### Ideas Behind IP Watermarking
#### Challenge:
- must maintain IP's value (funcionality, performance, quality, etc)

#### Observation

#### Approach:
- use IP's implementation or appearance as wartermark
